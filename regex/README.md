This project uses regular expressions to validate different types of fields and is mainly intended for testing purposes. Although it is an experimental project, it was developed with the aim of learning and practicing the use of regex in real projects.

###  About Regex

The origins of regex can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s, when computer scientists began exploring the concept of pattern matching in text. Since then, regex has become a fundamental tool for working with text data in a variety of contexts, including programming languages like Dart and platforms like Flutter.

In Flutter, regex can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

Validating user input, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or other text-based input
Parsing data from APIs, such as JSON or XML responses
Filtering or transforming data, such as text that needs to be reformatted or cleaned up
By using regular expressions, it is possible to create powerful and flexible solutions in Flutter.
